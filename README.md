### Description

<p>Bullying is a huge problem in today’s society. Studies show that one in three schoolchildren are affected by bullying. Since human character forms in young ages, this character forming could be controlled, and thus it could be helpful in preventing bullying kind of characters. So, we propose a solution to help the children to turn the tables against bullying. TurnTheTables is a 3D platformer game which applies psychological methods that are confirmed by psychologists. TurnTheTables consists of different scenarios based on these psychological methods. 
The aim of these scenarios is to educate the child to various ways of standing against bullying. The game takes place in a school campus, where the child can wonder around. The child comes across scenarios where s/he or some other child is exposed to bullying. The game will react to the child’s decisions to these scenarios with psychological messages. These messages are aimed to impact the child’s subconscious.</p>
